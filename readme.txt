This plugin allows your visitors to upload User Generated Content (media and posts/custom-post-types with media).

== Description ==

**What is Frontend Uploader?**

This plugin is a simple way for users to submit content to your site. The plugin uses a set of shortcodes to let you create highly customizable submission forms to your posts and pages. Once the content is submitted, it is held for moderation until you approve it. It’s that easy!

**Security**

Allowing uploads from unauthenticated users is inherently risky. The plugin relies on the core allow list for files. However, we explicitly remove HTML, JS and PHP files even if they're in the allow list. To modify the list of allowed file types and tweak it to your own desire either use the plugin's settings or refer to *fu_allowed_mime_types* configuration filter section for additional details.

For additional protection we recommend enabling file name obfuscation in plugin settings.

= Exploring Customizations =

* You can modify the submission form as needed, and have users submit posts. Please visit the FAQ page for more information.
* This plugin can be applied to Posts, Pages, and Custom Post Types. You can enable this via Settings > Frontend Uploader Settings.
* Form can be used in three modes:
	- Submit files
	- Submit posts/pages/custom post types
	- Submit a post and attach files to it

* The form supports following fields: text, textarea, select, radio buttons, and checkboxes

**Customizing Your Form with Shortcode Parameters**

Frontend Uploader is flexible and powerful, but unfortunately there's no visual form constructor at the moment - you have to use shortcodes. Please read this documentation carefully in order to leverage the plugin's features.

At it's most basic form, the shortcode would look like this
**[fu-upload-form]**

This will render a default form for media upload that has title, description and upload fields. (See screenshot 2)

The same shortcode with some customizations would look like this:

`[fu-upload-form class="html-wrapper-class" form_layout="media" title="Upload your media"]

	[input type="text" name="post_title" id="title"
	 class="required" description="Title"]

	[textarea name="post_content" class="textarea"
	 id="my-textarea" description="Description (optional)"]

	[input type="file" name="photo" id="my-photo-submission"
	 class="required" description="Your Photo" multiple="multiple"]

	[input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit"]
[/fu-upload-form]`

As you can see, form elements are represented by shortcodes: [input], [textarea], [radio], [checkboxes], [file]. Each of them has a set of attributes, e.g. `id, class, name, value, values, type, description, minlength, maxlength. Please refer to "Form Elements" section of this readme for more details on elements and their attributes.

## Main shortcode: [fu-upload-form] ##

The main shortcode, it has many important parameters that modify form behavior.

In the following example we are creating a form with title "Upload your story and image". The form will allow to submit a custom post type *story* with a file which is going to be automatically inserted at the end of the story. The story will have a category with ID 1. On successful submission user will be redirected to http://example.com/success-page/

`[fu-upload-form
	form_layout="post_media"
	title="Upload your story and image"
	class="my-class validate"
	post_type="story"
	append_to_post="true"
	success_page="http://example.com/success-page/"
	category="1"
][/fu-upload-form]`

### The list of all parameters for [fu-upload-form] ###

**form_layout**

This determines whether the form is saved as a post/custom post type (‘post’), as a media file (`media`), or as a post with images (`post_media`).  Default value is `media`.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form form_layout=”post”]`

**title**

Add this *[fu-upload-form]* shortcode, and this will be the Headline that will be displayed before the form.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form class="your-class" title="Upload your media"]`

**class**

HTML class of the form, defaults to 'validate'. If you want your form being validated - do not remove validate class. If you would like to item to be required before a user can submit, you can set it to ‘required.’

Example:

`[input type="text" name="post_title" id="title" class="required"]`

**post_type**

Set the post type of the upload to one in the plugin settings Allow list. Defaults to 'post'.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form post_type="my-custom-post-type-slug"]`

**append_to_post**

Automatically insert images into the uploaded post content *(true or false)*

Example:

`[fu-upload-form append_to_post="true"]`


**success_page**

URL to redirect on successful submission, defaults to the URL where the form is being displayed. For security reasons this should be an URL on your site (no external links). You can use `[fu-upload-response]` shortcode to display success/error messages on the redirect page.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form success_page="https://example.com/thank-you-for-your-submission/"]`

**category**

ID of category the post should be attached (only in post or post+media mode).

Example:

`[fu-upload-form category="1"]`

**post_id**

ID of the post the image should be attached to. Defaults to the post ID of the post the shortcode is on.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form post_id="103037"]`

**suppress_default_fields**

Override global setting for supressing default form fields *(true or false)*.

Example:

`[fu-upload-form suppress_default_fields="true"] ... inner shortcodes omitted... [/fu-upload-form]`

### Form Elements ###

The following are form elements you can use, please refer to *Field Attributes* section for more details on what attributes can be used.

Text box for one line of text:

`[input type="text" name="post_title" class="my-class" ]`

Text box for multiple lines of text:

`[textarea name="post_content" class="my-text-area"]`

File upload field:

`[input type="file" name="my-file"]`

Set of checkboxes:

`[checkboxes name="fruits" values="value:Description,124:Banana,cherry:Cherry"]`

Set of radio buttons:

`[radio name="fruit" class="checkboxes" description="Pick a fruit" values="value:Description,124:Banana,cherry:Cherry"]`

Select:

`[select name="select-fruit" class="select" description="Pick a fruit" values="apple:Apple,banana:Banana,cherry:Cherry"]`

Submit button:

`[input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit"]`

Recaptcha:

`[recaptcha]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Caveats**

You can modify the form as you'd like but you have to make sure that 'post_title' field is present, otherwise upload might fail

= I get a white screen or "0" when trying to upload a file =
The major cause of this is either request timeout or request exceeding maximum request size. This  means that either the file was uploading for too long or it was too big. PHP settings to look at are:
[max_execution_time](http://us1.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.max-execution-time) and [upload_max_filesize](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize), and [post_max_size](http://us3.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size). If you don't have any ability to modify these settings, please contact your hosting company's support.

= Where are the plugin's settings? =
You can find Frontend Uploader's settings under Settings > Frontend Uploader Settings.

= Can I get email notifications? =
Yes you can enable this in Settings > Frontend Uploader settings. By default the site admin will receive email notifications. If you’d like to change that to another email, you can also change that in settings.

= How are authors determined? =
If someone is logged in, their user profile is automatically linked to the post. Otherwise, you can enable an “Author Field” under Settings > Frontend Uploader that allows the users to write in their name.

= Are other filetypes supported? =

By default every file type that WordPress allows to upload except HTML and JS are enabled.
However, you can tweak what's allowed in the Options -> Frontend Uploader Settings.
If you want to handle some other file type please refer to **fu_allowed_mime_types** filter section.

= Where does the user submitted content go? =
If you used the default form, the uploaded file will go into Media > Manage UGC. You can have the submitted content go into Post > Manage UGC by setting the parameter: form_layout="post".

= Help, I pasted in the above shortcode and now my fields are duplicated =
As stated in previous answer, you don't need to put inner contents if you only need default form fields.
E.g. `[fu-upload-form class="your-class" title="Upload your media"]` will be enough to render the default form.
You can suppress rendering of default form fields with "Suppress default fields" checkbox in settings


= I want to allow users to upload a file type that's not listed in the plugin settings. =

By default we rely on [wp_get_mime_types](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_get_mime_types/) function to populate the values for the allow list.

It covers the absolute majority of widely used file formats, but let's say you want to allow uploading a source file of a program written in [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language).
It can be using either **.pas`** or **.p**
It can have MIME type of `text/pascal` or `text/x-pascal`

[FileExt](http://filext.com/) is a good place to find out more about the file types, but, unfortunately it stopped showing MIME-types somewhere between the first and current version of this readme.

So we'll have to resort to a search engine and query for "PAS MIME-type". As said earlier, those files can have two MIME-types.

Now comes the tricky part, WordPress expects the mime types defined in a particular format of a regex pattern for extensions as an array key and MIME-type as a value.

Needless to say, associative array keys are unique, so we need to apply a little trick:

`$mime_types['p|pas'] = 'text/pascal';
$mime_types['pas|p'] = 'text/x-pascal';`

This way we can side-step the unique key requirement while handling both of the MIME-types.

Put this in your theme's functions.php

`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	$mime_types['p|pas'] = 'text/pascal';
	$mime_types['pas|p'] = 'text/x-pascal';

	return $mime_types;
}`

Unfortunately, that's not all. Sometimes, depending on a server configuration you might get unexpected results for certain file extensions.
If you’re experiencing any issues, you can set WP_DEBUG to true in your wp-config.php or put

`add_filter( ‘fu_is_debug’, ‘__return_true’ );`

in your theme’s functions.php to see what MIME-types you are having troubles with.

= What about spam protection? =
The plugin supports Akismet (must be installed and configured properly) and Recaptcha. Just enable it in plugin settings.

= Configuration Filters =

= fu_manage_permissions =

By default Frontend Uploader could be managed with 'edit_posts' capability, if you want to change permissions, this is the right filter

`add_filter( 'fu_manage_permissions', create_function( '$cap', 'return "edit_others_posts"; ) );`

= fu_allowed_mime_types =

Allows you to add your custom MIME-types. Please note that there might be multiple MIME types per file extension.

`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	$mp3_mimes = array( 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/x-mpeg', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/x-mp3', 'audio/mpeg3', 'audio/x-mpeg3', 'audio/mpg', 'audio/x-mpg', 'audio/x-mpegaudio' );
	foreach( $mp3_mimes as $mp3_mime ) {
		$mime = $mp3_mime;
		preg_replace("/[^0-9a-zA-Z ]/", "", $mp3_mime );
		$mime_types['mp3|mp3_' . $mp3_mime ] = $mime;
	}
	return $mime_types;
}`

= fu_after_upload =

`add_action( 'fu_after_upload', 'my_fu_after_upload', 10, 3 );

function my_fu_after_upload( $attachment_ids, $success, $post_id ) {
	// do something with freshly uploaded files
	// This happens on POST request, so $_POST will also be available for you
}`

= fu_additional_html =

Allows you to add additional HTML to form

`add_action('fu_additional_html', 'my_fu_additional_html' );

function my_fu_additional_html() {
?>
<input type="hidden" name="my_custom_param" value="something" />
<?php
}`

= fu_is_debug =

If you're experiencing issues with upload it might be due to server misconfiguration, enabling debug mode will give you more detailed error messages

`add_filter( 'fu_is_debug', '__return_true' );`

= fu_upload_result =

This action runs after form was uploaded. Arguments are: (string) $layout (form layout), (array) $result - result of the upload.
`add_action( 'fu_upload_result', 'my_fu_upload_result', 10, 2 );

function my_fu_upload_result( $layout, $result ) {
	// do something
}`
