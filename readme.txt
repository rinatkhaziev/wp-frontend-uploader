This plugin allows your visitors to upload User Generated Content (media and posts/custom-post-types with media).

== Description ==

This plugin gives you an ability to easily accept, moderate and publish user generated content (currently, there are 3 modes: media, post, post + media). The plugin allows you to create a front end form with multiple fields (easily customizable with shortcodes). You can limit which MIME-types are supported for each field. All of the submissions are safely held for moderation in Media/Post/Custom Post Types menu under a special tab "Manage UGC". Review, moderate and publish. It's that easy!

This plugin supports multiple uploads for modern browsers (sorry, no IE). Multiple file uploads are enabled for default form. To use it in your custom shortcode add multiple="" attribute to file shortcode.

Here's example of default form (you don't need to enter all that if you want to use default form, just use [fu-upload-form]):

`[fu-upload-form class="your-class" title="Upload your media"]
[textarea name="caption" class="textarea" id="ug_caption" description="Description (optional)"]
[input type="file" name="photo" id="ug_photo" class="required" description="Your Photo" multiple=""]
[input type="submit" class="btn" value="Submit"]
[/fu-upload-form]`

You can also add select elements to your form like so:

[select name="foo" class="select" id="ug_select" description="Pick a fruit" values="Apple,Banana,Cherry"]

By default plugin allows all MIME-types that are whitelisted in WordPress. However, there's a filter if you need to add some exotic MIME-type. Refer to Other notes -> Configuration filters.

= New in v0.5 =

You can choose what type of files you allow your visitors to upload from Frontend Uploader Settings

= New in v0.4 =

Now your visitors are able to upload not only media, but guest posts as well!
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post_image"] to get default form to upload post content and images
Use [fu-upload-form form_layout="post"] to get default form to upload post content

You can also manage UGC for selected custom post types (Please refer to the plugin's settings page). By default, UGC is enabled for posts and attachments. If you want to be able to get any other post types UGC submissions just select desired post types at the plugin's settings page, and pass post_type='my_post_type' to the [fu-upload-form] shortcode

= fu_allowed_mime_types =

Allows you to add your custom MIME-types. Please note that there might be multiple MIME types per file extension.

`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	$mp3_mimes = array( 'audio/mpeg', 'audio/x-mpeg', 'audio/mp3', 'audio/x-mp3', 'audio/mpeg3', 'audio/x-mpeg3', 'audio/mpg', 'audio/x-mpg', 'audio/x-mpegaudio' );
	foreach( $mp3_mimes as $mp3_mime ) {
		$mime = $mp3_mime;
		preg_replace("/[^0-9a-zA-Z ]/", "", $mp3_mime );
		$mime_types['mp3|mp3_' . $mp3_mime ] = $mime;
	}
	return $mime_types;
}`

= fu_after_upload =

`add_action( 'fu_after_upload', 'my_fu_after_upload' );

function my_fu_after_upload( $attachment_ids ) {
	// do something with freshly uploaded files
	// This happens on POST request, so $_POST will also be available for you
}`

= fu_additional_html =

Allows you to add additional HTML to form

`add_action('fu_additional_html', 'my_fu_additional_html' );

function my_fu_additional_html() {
?>
<input type="hidden" name="my_custom_param" value="something" />
<?php
}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to be allow users to upload mp3, psd, or any other file restricted by default. =

You are able to do that within Frontend Uploader Settings admin page. The settings there cover the most popular extensions/MIME-types.
The trick is that the same file might have several different mime-types based on setup of server/client.
If you're experiencing any issues, you can set WP_DEBUG to true in your wp-config.php or put
`add_filter( 'fu_is_debug', '__return_true' );` in your theme's functions.php to see what MIME-types you are having troubles with.

[FileExt](http://filext.com/) is a good place to find MIME-types for specific file extension.

Let's say we want to be able to upload 3gp media files.

First we look up all MIME-types for 3gp: http://filext.com/file-extension/3gp

Now that we have all possible MIME-types for .3gp, we can allow the files to be uploaded.

Following code whitelists 3gp files, if it makes sense to you, you can modify it for other extensions/mime-types.
If it confuses you, please don't hesitate to post on support forum.
Put this in your theme's functions.php
`add_filter( 'fu_allowed_mime_types', 'my_fu_allowed_mime_types' );`
function my_fu_allowed_mime_types( $mime_types ) {
	// Array of 3gp mime types
	// From http://filext.com (there might be more)
	$mimes = array( 'audio/3gpp', 'video/3gpp' );
	// Iterate through all mime types and add this specific mime to allow it
	foreach( $mimes as $mime ) {
		// Preserve the mime_type
		$orig_mime = $mime;
		// Leave only alphanumeric characters (needed for unique array key)
		preg_replace("/[^0-9a-zA-Z ]/", "", $mime );
		// Workaround for unique array keys
		// If you-re going to modify it for your files
		// Don't forget to change extension in array key
		// E.g. $mime_types['pdf|pdf_' . $mime ] = $orig_mime
		$mime_types['3gp|3gp_' . $mime ] = $orig_mime;
	}
	return $mime_types;
}`
