## Description

This plugin gives you an ability to easily accept, moderate and publish user generated content (currently, there are 3 modes: media, post, post + media). The plugin allows you to create a front end form with multiple fields (easily customizable with shortcodes). You can limit which MIME-types are supported for each field. All of the submissions are safely held for moderation in Media/Post/Custom Post Types menu under a special tab "Manage UGC". Review, moderate and publish. It's that easy!
